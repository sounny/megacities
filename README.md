#Interactive Map of World Megacities
This project visualizes the population of world megacities from 1985 to 2015. The map is interactive, with a slider allowing the user to select a year and view the estimated population of each city. The size of the circles on the map corresponds to the population size.

##Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
Leaflet.js

##How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Use the slider at the bottom of the map to select a year.
Click on a circle to see the city name and its population for the selected year.

##Data
The data for the cities' population is hardcoded in the script tag within the index.html file. The data includes the name of the city, its coordinates (longitude and latitude), and its population for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.

##Functionality
When the user moves the slider, the map updates to show the populations of the cities for the selected year. Each city is represented by a circle, and the size of the circle corresponds to the population size. When the user clicks on a circle, a popup appears with the name of the city and its population for the selected year.

##Future Improvements
Update the data to include more recent years.
Add an API to fetch the most recent population data.
Add more cities to the data.
Improve the styling of the slider and the map.
